# img-glsl-webui
GLSL on images via WebGL (LLM generated)

### What's this?
You combine an image and glsl shader within the webui, you get to export them as png/jpg or webm afterwards.

### Why?
I wanted to use mu shaders to export images larger than my monitor resolution (mainly used hyprshade with screenshots). I spent a tiny, tiny bit of hours with claude 3.7 low (shout out t3 chat for cheap service) and somehow got this. It works well enough for me (so far).

### Is this slop?
It does its job, maybe.

### How to run?
Download the html file and open it with your browser. There's GitHub Pages too, if you don't want to run locally.

You can also use [my glsl](https://github.com/PopCat19/img-glsl-webui/blob/main/cool-stuff.glsl) from this repo. (its indeed 96% LLM generated shader :3)
